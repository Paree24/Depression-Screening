                <p>Depression is a common mental disorder, characterized by persistent sadness and a loss of interest in activities that you normally enjoy, accompanied by an inability to carry out daily activities, for at least two weeks. In addition, people with depression normally have several of the following; a loss of energy; a change in appetite; sleeping more or less; anxiety; reduced concentration; indecisiveness; restlessness; feelings of worthlessness, guilt or hopelessness; and thoughts of self-harm or suicide. Depression is treatable, with talking therapies or antidepressant medication or a combination of these.</p>

                <p>Psychotherapy (psychological therapy or talking therapy) is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change their behaviour and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health. Psychotherapists may be mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, or professional counselors.</p>

                <p>Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. </p>

                <br><h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>Based on the latest data we have, global suicide rates have been high the past few years. In some countries like the US, suicide rates haven’t been this high since the Second World War. The WHO estimates that each year, approximately one million people die from suicide, representing a global mortality rate of one death every 40 seconds. </p>

                <p>Just like physical illnesses, mental illnesses like depression don’t discriminate. Many famous and successful personalities have taken their own lives in recent years, a notable example being Chester Bennington, who was the lead vocalist of the widely successful American rock band Linkin Park. But despite this, arguably, mental health isn’t taken as seriously as physical health. The WHO says that globally, the availability and quality of data on suicide and suicide attempts is poor, which is a testament to this.  
                Therapy is a non-chemical solution to depression. But there are issues with it that often make it inaccessible – the quality of therapy depends on the competence of the therapist, which isn’t guaranteed; and people are often hesitant to seek therapy, as they are uncomfortable sharing their issues with another person, or aren’t able to afford it in the first place. </p>

                <p>Our project is meant to be a part of the progress of humanity towards better mental healthcare. We use a machine learning program that asks the patient questions, and determines the presence and level of depression in them based on the answers they give. The program also serves as a data collection platform to support the drive for more data on mental health.  </p>

                <p>Since there’s no human being paid for their time and presence, it’s free. Also, it’s a cold, non-judgemental software interface that the user interacts with – an anonymous QnA platform. Thus, in theory, our solution is more accessible than therapy sessions. </p>

                <p>Machine learning provides a better ability to upscale, upgrade and obtain results than hard coded algorithms. A machine learning model is an entity that understands the problem – this is obviously better for non-deterministic, real world problems like depression, compared to a pre-programmed system that can do nothing but go by the book. Intuitively, ML is the right approach for this problem, and we've thus used it. </p>

                <br><h1>Privacy</h1>
                <p>Visitors' questionnaire answers are recorded and used to generate downloadable statistics and reports for the information of them and their organization. Visitors' identities aren't taken in, in any way, shape, or form, let alone stored and associated with their responses, hence their questionnaire data is, despite being recorded, completely anonymous. </p>
